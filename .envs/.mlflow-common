# Here we are going to define some environment variables that are going to be needed
# both for the local and remote MLFlow tracking server. It will make more sense why we need
# such a file when we actually deploy MLFlow on GCP. For now, let's define some variables

LOCAL_DEV_MLFLOW_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
LOCAL_DEV_MLFLOW_SERVER_PORT=6101

PROD_MLFLOW_SERVER_PORT=6100


# Next, let's create .mlflow-dev env file
